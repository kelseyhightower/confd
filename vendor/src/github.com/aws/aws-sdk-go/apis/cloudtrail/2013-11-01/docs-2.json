Events for a region can be looked up for the times in which you had CloudTrail turned on in that region during the last seven days. Lookup supports five different attributes: time range (defined by a start time and end time), user name, event name, resource type, and resource name. All attributes are optional. The maximum number of attributes that can be specified in any one lookup request are time range and one other attribute. The default number of results returned is 10, with a maximum of 50 possible. The response includes a token that you can use to get the next page of results. The rate of lookup requests is limited to one per second per account.</p> <important>Events that occurred during the selected time range will not be available for lookup if CloudTrail logging was not enabled when the events occurred.</important>",

It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.</p> <p>CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.</p> <note> As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services page</a>. </note> <p>See the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in the log files.</p>",
