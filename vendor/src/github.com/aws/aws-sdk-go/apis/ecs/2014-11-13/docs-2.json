If you modify the task definition with <code>UpdateService</code>, Amazon ECS spawns a task with the new version of the task definition and then stops an old task after the new version is running. Because <code>UpdateService</code> starts a new version of the task before stopping an old version, your cluster must have capacity to support one more instantiation of the task when <code>UpdateService</code> is run.

This parameter specifies the minimum amount of CPU to reserve for a container, and containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount.</p> <p>For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.</p> <p>The Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint\">CPU share constraint</a> in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel will allow is 2; however, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:</p> <ul> <li> <b>Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:</b> Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to 2 CPU shares.</li> <li> <b>Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:</b> Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.</li> </ul>",

For Docker version 1.6.0 and later, the Docker daemon tries to read the ephemeral port range from <code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range</code>; if this kernel parameter is unavailable, the default ephemeral port range is used. You should not attempt to specify a host port in the ephemeral port range, since these are reserved for automatic assignment. In general, ports below 32768 are outside of the ephemeral port range.</p> <p>The default reserved ports are 22 for SSH, the Docker ports 2375 and 2376, and the Amazon ECS Container Agent port 51678. Any host port that was previously specified in a running task is also reserved while the task is running (once a task stops, the host port is released).The current reserved ports are displayed in the <code>remainingResources</code> of <a>DescribeContainerInstances</a> output, and a container instance may have up to 50 reserved ports at a time, including the default reserved ports (automatically assigned ports do not count toward this limit).</p>",
