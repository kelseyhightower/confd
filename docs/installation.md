# Installation

### Binary Download

Currently confd ships binaries for OS X and Linux 64bit systems. You can download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/releases)

#### OS X

```
$ wget https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/releases/download/v0.11.0/confd-0.11.0-darwin-amd64
```

#### Linux

```
$ wget https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/releases/download/v0.11.0/confd-0.11.0-linux-amd64
```

#### Building from Source

```
$ ./build
$ sudo ./install
```

#### Building from Source for Alpine Linux

Since many people are using Alpine Linux as their base images for Docker there's support to build Alpine package also. Naturally by using Docker itself. :)

```
$ docker build -t confd_builder -f Dockerfile.build.alpine .
$ docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/app confd_builder ./build
```
The above docker commands will produce binary in the local bin directory.

#### Build for your Image using Multi-Stage build

With multi-stage builds you can keep the whole process contained in your Dockerfile using: 

```
FROM alpine:3.6 as confd

ENV GOPATH /go

RUN mkdir -p "$GOPATH/src/" "$GOPATH/bin" && chmod -R 777 "$GOPATH" && \
    mkdir -p /go/src/github.com/kelseyhightower/confd

RUN apk --update add unzip curl go bash && \
    ln -s /go/src/github.com/kelseyhightower/confd /app

WORKDIR /app

RUN curl -L https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/archive/v0.12.0-alpha3.zip --output /tmp/confd.zip && \
    unzip -d /tmp/confd /tmp/confd.zip && \
    cp -r /tmp/confd/*/* /app && \
    rm -rf /tmp/confd* && \
    ./build

FROM tomcat:8.5.15-jre8-alpine

COPY --from=confd /app/bin/confd /usr/local/bin/confd

# Then do other useful things...
```
