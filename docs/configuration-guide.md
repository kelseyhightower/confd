# Configuration Guide

The confd configuration file is written in [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml)
and loaded from `/etc/confd/confd.toml` by default. You can specify the config file via the `-config-file` command line flag.

> Note: You can use confd without a configuration file. See [Command Line Flags](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/blob/master/docs/command-line-flags.md).

* `confdir` (string) - The path to confd configs. ("/etc/confd")
* `interval` (int) - The backend polling interval in seconds. (600)
* `log-level` (string) - level which confd should log messages ("info")

```TOML
backend = "etcd"
client_cert = "/etc/confd/ssl/client.crt"
client_key = "/etc/confd/ssl/client.key"
confdir = "/etc/confd"
log-level = "debug"
interval = 600
nodes = [
  "http://127.0.0.1:4001",
]
noop = false
prefix = "/production"
scheme = "https"
srv_domain = "etcd.example.com"
```
